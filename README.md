# DietMind

DietMind is an app that enables you to plan a balanced diet composed of what you want to eat. First, you choose which foods you want to include in your diet. Then, you choose how much of each nutrient you want to consume--including every mineral, vitamin, and amino acid that your body needs. Finally, DietMind will tell you how much of each food you need to eat to get all the nutrients you want.
